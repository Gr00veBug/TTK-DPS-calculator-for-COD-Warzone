# TTK-DPS-calculator-for-COD-Warzone
A simple calculator to create, save and list the TTK/DPS values of guns. 

scripted with Pycharm Community Edition, uses python 3.10

Command Line Usage:
python ttkcal.py

Install usage:

Download the ttkcalc archive.

export it anywhere (preferbly a folder that doesnt need admin rights, for security.)

right click on "ttkcalc.exe" and click "Create Shortcut"

move the shortcut to your desktop

click and run.


Extra Info:

This script will write files in the folder as you add weapons to your list. the file names are "advweaponlist.txt" and "weaponlist.txt"

the Advanced DPS Calculator asks for a ton of info to really get a true DPS, if you don't know the damage values for the guns, you can use trugamedata.com to grab them. 

The Incendiary round feature uses Vanguard's Incendiary damage values, does not include EOD perk in the calculations.

My antivirus did pick this up once and quarintined the file. SO PLEASE read the code and make sure it looks good before running, I know I am the creator, but don't trust anybody...
